TODO:
Display extended header information
Display frame information (basically everything that isn't the header)
Instead of assigning values from the header into properly named arrays,
  the header array could be used directly in the print statements. Currently it
  is the former way so the code could be a little clearer. Perhaps it is better
  that way.
Instead of the previous statement, make a struct unioned with a char array. That
  way I can get the best of both worlds. I guess?
