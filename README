displayid3 - displays an MP3 file's ID3 information, based on ID3v2.3

Usage: displayid3 filename
No options, only one filename argument accepted.

Based on my verifyid3 program available at https://github.com/Cantido/verifyid3
Documentation on the ID3v2.3 unofficial standard: http://id3.org/d3v2.3.0

TODO:
Display extended header information

Properly handle encodings of text frames and ramifications on blocks such as the
  COMM frame printer. The best way would probably be to read the body and
  transfer it to a string after the encoding is stripped.
  
Parse command line options with getopt

Allow printframe() to print different levels of verbosity

Rename tag_preserve and file_preserve members of struct frame to something like
  tag_discard, because the standard says that 1 indicates that the frame should
  be discarded, and having "tag_discard" set to 1 makes one assume that the
  frame should be discarded. Entirely source-code-asthetics.

Long-term TODO:
Recognize all versions of ID3
